# Claude Agent SDK Container Security Advisor

This standalone implementation uses the Claude Agent SDK (formerly the Claude
Code SDK) to explain bounded, sanitized Trivy findings. It does not import or
require the Google ADK project.

The trust boundary is deliberate:

```text
Claude proposes -> Trivy and deterministic policy decide -> Human approves
```

Claude has no tools, MCP servers, repository settings, or permission to read or
modify the workspace. It receives an allowlisted evidence envelope, runs for a
single turn, and returns a locally validated advisory. It cannot approve,
reject, waive, publish, or change a release decision. In particular,
`policy_decision: not_evaluated` is not approval.

The implementation pins `claude-sonnet-5`. Every JSON and Markdown advisory
records both the requested model and the model usage reported by Anthropic. The
advisory fails safely if model usage is missing or reports a non-Sonnet-5 model.
The SDK request pins both the primary and fallback model, and pins Claude Code's
Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, and subagent aliases to the same Sonnet 5 identifier so
background/default routing cannot introduce Opus usage.
The Sonnet 5 advisory requests a schema-shaped JSON response, parses exactly one
JSON object, and validates it against the local Pydantic schema. It also checks
every cited finding ID against the bounded scanner input. Native constrained
structured output is not enabled because it is not currently advertised for
Sonnet 5; local validation therefore remains mandatory.
Anthropic Console billing charts aggregate usage across the selected workspace
and date range, so Opus charges can come from unrelated Claude Code or API
sessions that use the same Anthropic account.

## Five-minute test

Requirements: Python 3.11+, `uv`, and either an existing Claude Code login or
an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Never commit credentials.

The SDK uses its bundled Claude Code CLI by default. To test a newer installed
CLI, set `CLAUDE_CODE_CLI_PATH` to that executable's absolute path.

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run claude-container-review \
  --triage-report examples/triage.json \
  --json-output reports/claude-review.json \
  --markdown-output reports/claude-review.md
```

Expected terminal output:

```text
Claude agent status: completed
Deterministic policy unchanged: True
```

If Claude authentication or the model is unavailable, the command still writes
an advisory artifact with `agent_status: unavailable`. That failure never
changes the input policy decision.

## Input contract

The input must be a JSON object containing `summary`, `findings`, and
`policy_decision`. Only these finding fields enter model context:

- `triage_item_id`, `id`, `kind`, `severity`, and `component`
- `installed_version`, `fixed_version`, and `scanner_status`
- `policy_blocking`
- `location.path` and `location.start_line`

Unknown fields—including possible secret values—are dropped. At most 50
findings are supplied by default, and every model-cited finding ID is checked
against that bounded input.

## CI/CD use

Run this after deterministic Trivy processing and before the human-facing
consolidated report. Treat its output as optional advisory evidence. Never add
the Claude job to a policy authorization expression, and never allow model
failure or model text to convert a blocked or unevaluated decision into an
approval.

The separate `Claude comprehensive container release` workflow has the same
deterministic release controls as the Google ADK workflow: SonarCloud analysis,
pre-build Trivy configuration policy, image vulnerability and secret scanning,
three HTML/PDF report layers, protected environment approval, and authorized
Docker Hub publishing. Its only agent stage is the tool-disabled Claude Sonnet
5 advisory over bounded `ci-triage.json` evidence. Configure the GitHub Actions
repository secret `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before running it.

The three report artifacts are the pre-build code/configuration report, the
container image security report, and the consolidated release security report.
Claude remains advisory and is never included in the deterministic release
authorization expression.
