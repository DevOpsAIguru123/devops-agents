# Five-minute setup

This quick start exercises the deterministic pipeline locally. SonarCloud,
Vertex AI, protected approvals, and Docker Hub are optional until you run the
complete GitHub Actions workflow.

## 1. Install prerequisites

Install Docker, Python 3.11+, Git, and [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/). Install `uv`
if you also want to run the ADK agent and its tests.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>.git
cd <REPOSITORY>/ADK/container-hardening
uv sync --frozen
```

## 2. Run deterministic tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit
```

These tests do not require a model API key or Google Cloud credentials.

## 3. Build and scan the hardened sample

```bash
cd examples/agentic-devops-portfolio
docker build --tag agentic-devops-portfolio:local .
mkdir -p reports/local
trivy config --format json --output reports/local/config.json .
trivy image --scanners vuln,secret --format json \
  --output reports/local/image.json agentic-devops-portfolio:local
```

Generated local evidence belongs under `reports/local/`, which is ignored by
Git. Do not commit fresh scanner output without sanitizing and intentionally
curating it as a test fixture.

## 4. Prove that policy blocks the vulnerable fixture

```bash
docker build --file Dockerfile.vulnerable \
  --tag agentic-devops-portfolio:vulnerable-demo .
trivy image --scanners vuln,secret --format json \
  --output reports/local/vulnerable-image.json \
  agentic-devops-portfolio:vulnerable-demo
trivy config --format json \
  --output reports/local/vulnerable-config.json \
  Dockerfile.vulnerable deployment.vulnerable.yaml
python3 scripts/evaluate_release.py \
  --image-report reports/local/vulnerable-image.json \
  --config-report reports/local/vulnerable-config.json \
  --output reports/local/vulnerable-decision.json
```

The final command should return nonzero with `policy_decision: blocked`. That is
the expected test result.

## 5. Enable the complete hosted workflow

1. Create the SonarCloud project and repository secrets documented in
   [Authentication and CI configuration](AUTHENTICATION.md).
2. Create a `container-production` GitHub Environment and require reviewers.
3. Run **Container security release** with `Dockerfile` and `publish: false`.
4. Inspect the overall job summary and the three report artifacts.

Keep `publish: false` until your own policy, IAM, registry, branch protection,
and environment-review controls have been validated.
