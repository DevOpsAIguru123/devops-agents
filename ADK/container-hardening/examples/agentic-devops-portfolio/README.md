# Agentic DevOps Portfolio

A static, responsive sample portfolio served by an unprivileged NGINX process.

## Build and run

```bash
docker build -t agentic-devops-portfolio:local .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 agentic-devops-portfolio:local
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
```

## Scan

```bash
mkdir -p reports
trivy image --format json --output reports/trivy-image.json agentic-devops-portfolio:local
trivy config --format json --output reports/trivy-config.json .
```

The image runs as the `nginx` user, listens on port 8080, writes temporary files
under `/tmp`, and sends logs to stdout/stderr.

## Intentionally vulnerable release-gate demonstration

`Dockerfile.vulnerable` and `deployment.vulnerable.yaml` are isolated training
fixtures. They must never be published or deployed. Build and scan them locally:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
  --file Dockerfile.vulnerable \
  --tag agentic-devops-portfolio:vulnerable-demo .

trivy image --format json \
  --output reports/vulnerable-image-trivy.json \
  agentic-devops-portfolio:vulnerable-demo

trivy config --format json \
  --output reports/vulnerable-config-trivy.json \
  .

python3 scripts/evaluate_release.py \
  --image-report reports/vulnerable-image-trivy.json \
  --config-report reports/vulnerable-config-trivy.json \
  --output reports/vulnerable-policy-decision.json
```

The final command exits nonzero when policy blocks the candidate. A CI pipeline
must place `docker push` after this gate using conditional execution, so a
blocked result makes the push step unreachable.

## GitHub Actions release pipeline

The repository workflow `.github/workflows/container-security-release.yml`
uses isolated jobs:

1. SonarQube source analysis and Quality Gate enforcement runs in parallel
   with a dedicated Trivy configuration scan of the exact Dockerfile and
   deployment configuration selected for release.
2. The deterministic pre-build configuration policy must pass before the
   Docker build is reachable. The approved configuration evidence is then
   reused with the Trivy image vulnerability/secret scan by the final
   deterministic release-policy gate. Every Trivy occurrence is also ranked
   into an advisory triage queue, rendered in the Actions job summary, retained
   as Markdown/JSON/SARIF evidence, and uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning when
   that repository feature is available.
3. A report aggregation stage that exports SonarQube Cloud findings and joins
   them with the normalized Trivy image/configuration triage. It publishes one
   complete Markdown report for people and one JSON report for automation.
4. A separate Vertex AI/ADK advisory stage that consumes the bounded,
   secret-safe deterministic triage data and proposes prioritized remediation,
   compatibility checks, attack-path hypotheses, and verification steps.
5. A required-reviewer approval gate on the protected
   `container-production` GitHub Environment, followed by Docker Hub
   authentication and push. The publish job is reachable only after the Sonar
   and deterministic container-security jobs succeed and the machine-readable
   decision says `publish_allowed: true`.

The generated `ci-unified-security.md` is the primary team-facing report and is
rendered directly in the Actions job summary. Its companion
`ci-unified-security.json` retains the complete Sonar code findings, security
hotspots, Trivy image/configuration findings, metrics, and independent gate
outcomes. The original `ci-triage.json`, `ci-triage.md`, and `ci-trivy.sarif`
remain available as scanner-specific evidence and GitHub Security-tab input.
Scanner and agent triage are advisory: `policy_decision: not_evaluated` is
never approval. Only `ci-policy-decision.json` can authorize publishing.

If a release is blocked, reporting and evidence upload still run before the job
fails. This gives developers and security reviewers the explanation needed to
remediate the candidate without weakening the fail-closed release gate.

The ADK job is deliberately non-authoritative. A model outage or malformed
model response is recorded as `agent_status: unavailable` and cannot approve,
block, or change a release decision. Pull-request code receives no Google Cloud
credential; it produces the deterministic report plus an explicit unavailable
agent report. Trusted `main` runs authenticate to Vertex AI through Workload
Identity Federation. The dedicated `codex/gemini-api-secret-agent` branch can
also federate during an explicitly dispatched, non-publishing validation run.

Configure these GitHub repository settings before running it:

| Type | Name | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secret | `SONAR_TOKEN` | SonarQube project analysis token |
| Secret | `SONAR_HOST_URL` | SonarQube URL, such as `https://sonar.example.com` |
| Secret | `SONAR_ORGANIZATION` | SonarQube Cloud organization key |
| Secret | `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Docker Hub access token; do not use the account password |
| Secret | `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Docker Hub namespace |
| Secret | `DOCKERHUB_REPOSITORY` | Existing public Docker Hub repository name |

Create a SonarQube project whose key is `agentic-devops-portfolio`, matching
`sonar-project.properties`. For SonarQube Cloud, set `SONAR_ORGANIZATION` to
the organization **key** shown in the SonarQube Cloud organization settings,
not the display name. Configure the Docker Hub repository as public in Docker
Hub; pushing an image does not itself change repository visibility.

To configure the settings without exposing tokens in the repository, edit the
git-ignored `.github/container-release.settings` placeholder file from the
repository root. Then authenticate GitHub CLI and upload the values:

```bash
gh auth login --hostname github.com
.github/scripts/configure-container-release-settings.sh
```

The helper refuses to upload unchanged placeholders and never prints token
values. A safe, commit-ready template is available at
`.github/container-release.settings.example`.

Pull requests run every analysis and gate but never publish. Pushes to `main`
publish the hardened `Dockerfile` only after deterministic authorization and a
reviewer approves the `container-production` deployment. To prove blocking, run
the workflow manually with `Dockerfile.vulnerable`; the policy step fails,
scan reports are uploaded for review, no release bundle is produced, and the
publish job is skipped even if `publish` was requested.

To exercise the protected-environment approval UI without publishing, dispatch
the workflow from `codex/gemini-api-secret-agent` with `approval_test: true`
and `publish: false`. The release-approval job waits for the configured
reviewer, records the approval, and the Docker Hub publish job remains skipped.

To test the complete publish path from that dedicated feature branch, dispatch
with `publish: true` and approve the protected environment. A successful run
pushes only the immutable `feature-<commit-sha>` tag. It never overwrites the
production `latest` tag; SHA and `latest` publication remain exclusive to
`main`.
